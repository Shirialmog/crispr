<h1> Welcome to Base Editors </h1>
    <p>The bioinformatic tools we develop address the basic interests of molecular biologists
        in gene-editing experimental design.
        We currently offer 2 web tools for distinct purposes:
        CrisPam identifies PAM sequences generated by a SNP.
        It may be helpful for targeting a pathogenic SNP in heterozygous models.
        BE Matcher finds the most fit base editor to achieve the correction of a SNP.
        Both tools offer a database of human pathogenic SNPs (obtained from NCBI)
        and their corresponding Cas / Base editor to carry out the gene-editing aims. </p>
